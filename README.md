# Django-Blog-API
A complete backend for a blog application containing two working REST APIs
Requirements for project :

Implement basic CRUD functionalities like creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting blog posts.
Each blog post should contain the title, content, author, publication date, and tags.
Implement Django Rest Framework (DRF) for the backend and SQL for the database.
Use JWT for authentication and allow authors to update only their own blog posts.
Every user/author should be able to view all other authors' blog posts.
Create a trigger that updates the "last_blog" field in the User/Author table when a new blog post is created.
Use a SQL procedure for GET operations to retrieve blogs along with their corresponding author information.
Enable searching for blogs based on their title and author name, and publication date.
Ensure the application meets professional-quality standards.

JWT Authentication Used.
Database used = Posgresql
APIs Tested on Postman
